Skatepark Pinball is an arcade game created by Vimto. Our goal is get the maximum number of points possible.

And We did a new version of this Vimto's pinball:
	http://www.classicgame.com/game/Skatepark+Pinball

CONTROLS:

-Down arrow: Launch Ball.
-Left/Right arrow: move left/right arrows.

-F1: Show collision grids.


GODMODE:

- If the colliders are showed (with F1 key) you can move the ball with your mouse by clicking in it, if you stop clicking the ball will return to its normal state.


LOSE CONDITION:

- Your ball falls 4 times.

There is no win condition, just get the maximum amount of points you can!


Our version won't have the following elements respect to the original:

-Menus.

-Character animation when yellow lever is pushed.

-Smash the characters.

-Break the glass when you lose

-Liquid animations crossing tubes. 

- The valves rotate from the start. In the original valves start spinning when you smash the characters.

-Some animations passing above ground sensors (only upper left and Vimto symbol).



Differences from the original:

-Instead of using the button to smash the fruits We use It to give a double point bonus for 30 seconds.

-The Button will appear whenever we activate the yellow lever instead of having to press it 3 times.

-Right tunnel retains the ball 2 seconds instead of 3.
