Skatepark Pinball is an arcade game created by Vimto. Our goal is get the maximum number of points possible.

We are:
Marc Latorre (https://github.com/marclafr)
Francisco Ruiz (https://github.com/ValencianoFran)

And We did a new version of this Vimto's pinball:
	http://www.classicgame.com/game/Skatepark+Pinball

CONTROLS:

-Space: Launch Ball.
-Left/Right arrow: move left/right arrows.
-F1: Show collision grids.

Our version won't have the following elements respect to the original:

-Menus.

-Character animation when yellow lever is pushed.

-Smash the characters.

-Break the glass when you lose

-Liquid animations crossing tubes. 

- The valves rotate from the start. In the original valves start spinning when you smash the characters.

-Some animations passing above ground sensors (only upper left and Vimto symbol).



Differences from the original:

-Instead of using the button to smash the fruits We use It to give a double point bonus for 30 seconds.

-The Button will appear whenever we activate the yellow lever instead of having to press it 3 times.

-Right tunnel retains the ball 2 seconds instead of 3.
